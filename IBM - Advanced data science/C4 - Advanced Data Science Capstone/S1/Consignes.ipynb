    "Feature Creation and Feature Engineering is one of the most important tasks in machine learning since it hugely impacts model performance. This also holds for deep learning, although to a lesser extent. Features can be changed or new features can be created from existing ones\n",
    "\n",
    "The following none exhaustive list gives you some guidelines for feature transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Imputing** Some algorithms are very sensitive to missing values. Therefore, imputing allows for filling of empty fields based on its value distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Imputed time-series quantization** Time series often contain streams with measurements at different timestamps. Therefore, it is beneficial to quantize measurements to a common “heart beat” and impute the corresponding values. This can be done by sampling from the source time series distributions on the respective quantized time steps  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Scaling / Normalizing / Centering** Some algorithms are very sensitive differences in value ranges for individual fields. Therefore, it is best practice to center data around zero and scale values to a standard deviation of one  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Filtering** Sometimes imputing values doesn’t perform well, therefore deletion of low quality records is a better strategy  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Discretizing** Continuous fields might confuse the model, e.g. a discrete set of age ranges sometimes performs better than continuous values, especially on smaller amounts of data and with simpler models \n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **One-hot-encoding** Categorical integer features should be transformed into “one-hot” vectors. In relational terms this results in addition of additional columns – one columns for each distinct category  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Time-to-Frequency transformation** Time-series (and sometimes also sequence data) is recorded in the time domain but can easily transformed into the frequency domain e.g. using FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Month-From-Date** Creating an additional feature containing the month independent from data captures seasonal aspects. Sometimes further discretization in to quarters helps as well  \n",
    "\n",
    "·      **Aggregate-on-Target** Simply aggregating fields the target variable (or even other fields) can improve performance, e.g. count number of data points per ZIP code or take the median of all values by geographical region"
